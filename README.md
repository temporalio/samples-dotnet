## Development

### Code formatting

This project uses StyleCop analyzers with some overrides in `.editorconfig`. To format, run:

    dotnet format

Can also run with `--verify-no-changes` to ensure it is formatted.

#### VisualStudio Code

When developing in vscode, the following JSON settings will enable StyleCop analyzers:

```json
    "omnisharp.enableEditorConfigSupport": true,
    "omnisharp.enableRoslynAnalyzers": true
```

### Testing

Run:

    dotnet test

Can add options like:

* `--logger "console;verbosity=detailed"` to show logs
* `--filter "FullyQualifiedName=TemporalioSamples.Tests.ActivityWorker.ActivityWorkerTests.Main_RunActivity_Succeeds"`
  to run a specific test

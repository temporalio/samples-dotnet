* [OpenTelemetry](src/OpenTelemetry) - Demonstrates how to set up OpenTelemetry tracing and metrics for both the client and worker, using both the .NET metrics API and internal forwarding from the Core SDK.
* [Patching](src/Patching) - Alter workflows safely with Patch and DeprecatePatch.
* [Polling](src/Polling) - Recommended implementation of an activity that needs to periodically poll an external resource waiting its successful completion.

* [Timer](src/Timer) - Use a timer to implement a monthly subscription; handle workflow cancellation.
* [UpdateWithStartEarlyReturn](src/UpdateWithStartEarlyReturn) - Use update with start to get an early return, letting the rest of the workflow complete in the background.
* [UpdateWithStartLazyInit](src/UpdateWithStartLazyInit) - Use update with start to lazily start a workflow before sending update.
* [WorkerSpecificTaskQueues](src/WorkerSpecificTaskQueues) - Use a unique task queue per Worker to have certain Activities only run on that specific Worker.
* [WorkerVersioning](src/WorkerVersioning) - How to use the Worker Versioning feature to more easily deploy changes to Workflow & other code.
* [WorkflowUpdate](src/WorkflowUpdate) - How to use the Workflow Update feature while blocking in update method for concurrent updates.

## Development

### Code formatting

This project uses StyleCop analyzers with some overrides in `.editorconfig`. To format, run:

    dotnet format

Can also run with `--verify-no-changes` to ensure it is formatted.

#### VisualStudio Code

When developing in vscode, the following JSON settings will enable StyleCop analyzers:

```json
    "omnisharp.enableEditorConfigSupport": true,
    "omnisharp.enableRoslynAnalyzers": true
```

### Testing

Run:

    dotnet test

Can add options like:

* `--logger "console;verbosity=detailed"` to show logs
* `--filter "FullyQualifiedName=TemporalioSamples.Tests.ActivityWorker.ActivityWorkerTests.Main_RunActivity_Succeeds"`
  to run a specific test

There is also a standalone project for running tests so output is more visible. To use it, run
`dotnet run --project tests/TemporalioSamples.Tests.csproj` and can pass options after `--`, e.g. `-- -verbose` and/or
`-- -method "*.RunAsync_SimpleRun_SucceedsAfterRetry"`.

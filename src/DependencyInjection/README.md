# Dependency Injection

This sample shows an activity having a dependency injected and a worker running as a generic host.

To run, first see [README.md](../../README.md) for prerequisites. Then, run the following from this directory
in a separate terminal to start the worker:

    dotnet run worker

Then in another terminal, run the workflow from this directory:

    dotnet run workflow

This will show logs in the worker window of the workflow running.

# Interceptors

This sample demonstrates how to use interceptors to propagate contextual information from an `AsyncLocal` throughout the
workflows and activities. While this demonstrates context propagation specifically, it can also be used to show how to
create interceptors for any other purpose.

To run, first see [README.md](../../README.md) for prerequisites. Then, run the following from this directory in a
separate terminal to start the worker:

    dotnet run worker

Then in another terminal, run the workflow from this directory:

    dotnet run workflow

The workflow terminal will show the completed workflow result and the worker terminal will show the contextual user ID
is present in the workflow and activity.
